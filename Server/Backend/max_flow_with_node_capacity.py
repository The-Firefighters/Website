def min_cut_with_node_capacity(graph: nx.DiGraph, source: int = None, target: int = None) -> set:
    """
    Computes a minimum cut in the given graph, where each node has a capacity

    Parameters:
    ----------
    graph : nx.DiGraph
        The original directed graph. Each node should have a 'capacity' attribute.
    source (Optional) : int
        The source node in the graph. This node will have an infinite capacity 
        between its "in" and "out" nodes.
    target (Optional) : int
        The target node in the graph. This node will have an infinite capacity 
        between its "in" and "out" nodes

    Returns:
    -------
    set
       The minimum cut nodes 

    Notes:
    -----
    This function transforms a given directed graph into a new graph where each node
    is split into two nodes (an "in" node and an "out" node) connected by an edge 
    with a capacity (weight). The transformation is used for flow problems where 
    nodes have capacities instead of edges - allowing to run algorithms which
    were originally designed to be used for edge-flow problems.
    - If a node does not have a 'capacity' attribute, a default capacity of 1 
      is used.
    - There is infinite capacity between two different edge_out & edge_in

    Examples:
    --------
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> G.add_node(1, capacity=0.6)
    >>> G.add_node(2, capacity=0.6)
    >>> G.add_node(3, capacity=0.3)
    >>> G.add_node(4, capacity=0.3)
    >>> G.add_edge(0, 1)
    >>> G.add_edge(0, 2)
    >>> G.add_edge(2, 3)
    >>> G.add_edge(1, 4)
    >>> s_t_G = create_st_graph(G, [2,4], 't')
    >>> min_cut_nodes = min_cut_with_node_capacity(s_t_G, 0, 4)
    >>> sorted(min_cut_nodes)
